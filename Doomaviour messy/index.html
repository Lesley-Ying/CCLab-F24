    <h3>Scientific Name:</h3>
    <p>Doomaviour</p>

    <h3>Family:</h3>
    <p>So far, the only one be discovered</p>

    <h3>Habitat:</h3>
    <p>An antidepressant drug under experiment, then I moved it onto a new optical viewing device</p>

    <h3>Appearance:</h3>
    <p>it is a cell-like creature, and its visibility is instable. It doesn’t have a fixed margin and its shape changes
        when being exposed to different types of music.

    <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sensitive to <span class="music">music</span></li>
        <li>Very emotional</li>
        <li>Sometimes goes extreme</li>

        What we know so far about [ NAME OF YOUR CREATURE ]?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I’m a scientist primarily engaged in pharmaceutical research. One day doing an experiment, I was distracted by a
        nearby live-house show. As I adjusted my mindset and prepared to add the reagent again, the solution in the test
        tube I was holding suddenly started to bubble. The originally purple mixture began to vibrate slightly and
        gradually turned transparent; simultaneously, the volume of the mixture appeared to decrease. I was startled
        because, theoretically, no chemical reaction should have occurred before I added the new reagent. I quickly took
        a sample of the reagent and placed it under my new optical instrument for examination. This new optical
        instrument has a wavy texture on its slide, which can display different kurtosis differences based on the
        activity level of the observed object.
        Under the optical instrument, it continuously changed its boundaries. Whenever I added a chemical reagent, it
        would first linger near the reagent to observe, then aggressively engulf and assimilate the foreign reagent. It
        exhibited diverse reactions according to the properties of different reagents while increasing its own volume. I
        wanted to investigate its tolerance limit, so when I brought out the strongest chemical reagent, it showed a
        violent reaction, self-cannibalized, and eventually released all the absorbed chemical substances, but
        disappeared itself.
        I was surprised by the behavior of this cell, as it consumed all harmful substances and ultimately couldn't bear
        its own disappearance, much like many patients with mental health issues I've encountered.

        Guidelines for human interaction with this creature

    <p>
        Try to “feed” it different types of music and then see how it react to different emotions
