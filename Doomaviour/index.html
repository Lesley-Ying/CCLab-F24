                <p>it is a cell-like creature, and its visibility is instable. It doesn’t have a fixed margin and its shape changes
                    when being exposed to different types of music.</p>

                I’m a scientist primarily engaged in pharmaceutical research. One day doing an experiment, I was distracted by a
        nearby live-house show. As I adjusted my mindset and prepared to add the reagent again, the solution in the test
        tube I was holding suddenly started to bubble. The originally purple mixture began to vibrate slightly and
        gradually turned transparent.I quickly took a sample of the reagent and placed it under my new optical instrument for examination. 
        Under the optical instrument, as I played different types of song, it continuously changed its boundaries.  It
        exhibited diverse reactions according to the type of songs. I wanted to investigate its tolerance limit, so when I brought out the heavy metal music, it showed a
        violent reaction, disappeared itself.
        I was surprised by the behavior of this cell, as it consumed all harmful substances and under extreme condition, it dissapears itself.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                Try to “feed” it different types of music and then see how it react to different emotions
